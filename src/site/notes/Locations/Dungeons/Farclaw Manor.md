Tall trees cast a blanket of darkness across the old wooded manor as it lay nestled in smothering greenery. Thick vines wrap up the sides, as a large willow tree looms from behind. 
Windows watching from above are broken, barred or boarded up with no traces of light from within.

Once home to the prestigious Farclaw Family, the manor has fallen into disarray after their disappearance.
