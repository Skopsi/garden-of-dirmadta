**Castle Myre**—or what remains of it—rests in the hollow of a narrow valley, pressed between the shadowed boughs of the eastern Gloaming Forest and the murk of the southern marshes. Even in ruin, its stonework speaks of the artisans who shaped it: every brick bears delicate carvings of vines, runes, and flowing motifs, as though the very hand of the fey once guided each chisel stroke.

The architecture rises in sweeping arches and grand, spiraling towers. Beauty, not battle, defined Castle Myre. It was raised in an age when the Green Knights guarded a peaceful realm, and so its walls were never meant to withstand true war. Only later, when the first demonic incursions spilled from the cursed woods, were crude iron gates and hastily hammered portcullises added—poor defenses for a place built for grace.

The Green Knights who survived those dark days have long since lost their minds, their fey-bound bodies twisted by the curse that clings to the land. Yet still they wander the shattered halls, eternally guarding the castle they once protected in life.
