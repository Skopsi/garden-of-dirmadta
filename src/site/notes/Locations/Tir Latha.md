**Tir Latha** is a half-whispered realm said to have been _painted into existence_ by the first fey artisans—its hills brushed in shimmering greens, its rivers inked with silver, and its sky layered in impossible hues. Travelers claim that within its shifting borders lie **glorious treasures**, **ancient fey relics**, and **castles crafted with such artistry** that the stone itself seems alive. Though no trustworthy souls claim to have seen it, legends insist that Tir Latha still waits beyond the veil, a masterpiece-world where beauty and danger blend seamlessly, and where every stroke of the landscape hides a secret worth seeking.
