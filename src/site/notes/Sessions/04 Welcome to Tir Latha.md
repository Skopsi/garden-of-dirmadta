- The party awakes in a daze on the floor of the [[Locations/Gloaming Forest\|Gloaming Forest]]. They are surrounded by black marrow trees and lay paralyzed. A red cloaked figure dressed in shining adornments walks between them speaking Diabolic. He bends down near [[Characters/Goose\|Goose]] while speaking a prayer and pulls out a knife. [[Lore/NPCs/Brigg\|Brigg]] interrupts but is quickly incapacitated by a spell and quickly stabbed by the [[Red Judge\|Red Judge]]. The Red Judge reveals that Brigg is a Farclaw and captures him. The rest of the party is left behind for the [[Bestiary/Skrell\|Skrell]].
