After a regular at the Rusted Chain gives away the location of an abandoned manor that is ripe for looting, the [[Lore/Factions/Golden Maggots\|Golden Maggots]] spring into action and head towards the [[Locations/Dungeons/Farclaw Manor\|Farclaw Manor]].

Spearheaded by [[Lore/NPCs/Brigg\|Brigg]], the gang's mission is to find access to the cellar below, as that is where the real valuables dwell.

Most of the gang and other participants of the raid are attacked by swarms of sting bats, and only a lucky few manage to make it inside the manor.
