A gang that has taken up business on the outskirts of Makdain.
True members are recognized by having one of their teeth replaced by a golden replicant.
Typical activities include harassing travelers or mugging merchants. Although many serve as good candidates for odd jobs or needed muscle.
All answer to the leader, [[Lore/NPCs/Brigg\|Brigg]].
