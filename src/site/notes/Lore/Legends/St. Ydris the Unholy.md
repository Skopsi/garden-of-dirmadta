A courageous member of the [[Lore/Factions/Green Knights\|Green Knights]].

His possession by [[Lore/Legends/Tzakoru\|Tzakoru]] led to the downfall of the Green Knights.
Eventually St. Ydris was brought down and contained in a magic circle under what is now known as [[Locations/Settlements/Greywall Priory\|Greywall Priory]].

He remains bound painfully (and willingly) deep beneath in the catacombs, and is used as a conduit for the [[Lore/Factions/Knights of St. Ydris\|Knights of St. Ydris]] to benefit from the blood of Tzakoru.
