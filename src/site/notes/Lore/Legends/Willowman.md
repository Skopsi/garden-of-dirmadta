A tall lanky humanoid figure made up of twisted branches and orange marshlights.
It feeds off of fear and is capable of cursing it's victims with [[Lore/Legends/Willow Blight\|Willow Blight]] with just one touch.

It is only capable of stalking in forests where other victims of the blight have perished.
